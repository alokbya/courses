Monte Carlo Integration

pick a random point
find out if they are underneath or above the function line
the area of the curve is equal to:
    (the number of points inside/the number of points over)*area


Take aways:

    Use subprocesses

    Wrap things up in classes: hide the gnarly code

    Monte Carlo gives a good appx
